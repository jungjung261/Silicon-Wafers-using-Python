# Silicon-Wafers-using-Python

Problem:
  Semiconductor device fabrication is the process of creating integrated circuits on silicon wafers. Each
silicon wafer is divided into small blocks called dies. Often the silicon wafer might have defects causing
certain sections of the wafer to become unusable. Often some wafers may be salvaged if only a relatively
small area of the wafer is defective. To analyze if a wafer can be salvaged, we must find the area of the
single largest rectangular section which does not contain a single defective die. Given a wafer defect map,
your task is to identify the area of the largest rectangle that does not contain a single defective die.
  The wafer defect map is provided in the form of a 2D matrix where usable dies are marked with 1 and the
defective unusable ones are marked with a 0. In the following example, the maximal usable section has been
identified with an area of 8 dies.
